Information Sheet for USER
----------------------------

1. Simulation Details :

    omega_m = 0.308
    omega_l = 0.692
    h = 0.678
    omega_b = 0.04
    sigma_8 = 0.829
    ns = 0.961
    YHe = 0.24

    Box Length = 160 cMpc/h

    Grid Cell Length = 2 cMpc/h

    No of grids along each direction (ngrid) = 80 

    So, there are 80^3 grid cells in total 

2. Redshift at which files are shared :

    z = 9.0 
    Mass Averaged Ionized Fraction =  0.162
    Number of galaxies  = 189692

    z = 8.0 
    Mass Averaged Ionized Fraction =  0.303
    Number of galaxies  = 420462

    z = 7.0 
    Mass Averaged Ionized Fraction =  0.543
    Number of galaxies  = 830634

    z = 6.0 
    Mass Averaged Ionized Fraction =  0.927
    Number of galaxies  = 1459007

    Mass Averaged Ionized fraction = Mean of " QHII_cell * ( 1 + densitycontrast_cell) "  over all cells 
    where QHII_cell is the ionized fraction and densitycontrast_cell is the density contrast of the cell 

 
3. Description of individual files shared for each redshift bin :

    A. Ionized fraction field 

    Contains the ionization fraction in each cell of the simulation box (unitless) : qion_arr 


    B. Density Contrast field  

    Contains the density contrast in each cell of the simulation box (unitless) : densitycontrast_arr 


    C. Galaxy Catalogue

    (i) galaxyCatalog_UVmagnitudes_z***.**.npz 

        Contains the UV magnitude of each galaxy (units= AB mag) : MUV_arr

    (ii) galaxyCatalog_Xposition_z***.**.npz 

        Contains the X-coordinate position of each galaxy (units= cMpc/h) : xpos_arr 

    (iii) galaxyCatalog_Yposition_z***.**.npz 

        Contains the Y-coordinate position of each galaxy (units= cMpc/h) : ypos_arr 

    (iv) galaxyCatalog_Zposition_z***.**.npz 

        Contains the Z-coordinate position of each galaxy (units= cMpc/h) : zpos_arr 

    So for the Mth galaxy (i.e., array_index = M-1), 
    the set of its properties are MUV_arr[M-1] ; xpos_arr[M-1] ; ypos_arr[M-1] ; zpos_arr[M-1]

4. Other Information :

    A seperate folder named "extra_plots" contains some visualization plots, such as : 

         a. The luminosity function of the galaxies in the mock catalog at different redshifts  
         b. Dimmensionless cross-power spectrum of the mass-averaged neutral hydrogen field and galaxy field at different redshifts. [Definitions used for the calculation are given in a seperate image file]
